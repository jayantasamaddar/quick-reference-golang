# Data Structures

Data structures are fundamental components in computer science that play a crucial role in organizing and managing data efficiently. They are essentially the building blocks used to store, retrieve, and manipulate information within a computer program. Data structures provide a means to represent, store, and work with data in a structured and organized manner, making it easier for computers to perform various operations on the data.

In computer science, data structures serve two primary purposes:

1. **Data Organization:** Data structures help in organizing data in a way that makes it easy to access and manipulate. Depending on the specific data structure used, data can be stored in a particular order, such as sorted, indexed, or hierarchically structured.

2. **Algorithm Efficiency:** Different data structures have varying degrees of efficiency for different operations. Choosing the right data structure for a specific task can significantly impact the performance of algorithms and the overall efficiency of a computer program.

There are a wide variety of data structures available, each with its own characteristics and use cases. Some common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables. Each of these structures is suited to different types of data and operations.

The choice of a data structure depends on several factors, including the nature of the data, the types of operations to be performed on the data, and the efficiency requirements of the program. Computer scientists and software engineers often need to analyze these factors carefully to select the most appropriate data structure for a given problem.

Understanding data structures is essential for computer scientists and programmers because it enables them to design efficient algorithms, optimize code, and ultimately build software systems that can handle and process data effectively. Mastery of data structures is a fundamental skill in the field of computer science and is vital for solving a wide range of computational problems.

# Types of Data Structures

There are several types of data structures used in computer science today, each with its own characteristics and use cases. Here is an overview of some common types of data structures:

1. **Arrays:** Arrays are collections of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. They are indexed by integers and provide fast access to elements but have fixed sizes. (Go already has Arrays)

2. **Linked Lists:** Linked lists consist of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node. Linked lists are flexible in size and allow for efficient insertions and deletions but may have slower access times than arrays. ([View LinkedList implementation](ds/LinkedList.go))

3. **Stacks:** Stacks are linear data structures that follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. They are used for managing function calls, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms. ([View Stack implementation](ds/Stack.go))

4. **Queues:** Queues are linear data structures that follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. They are commonly used for scheduling tasks, managing resources, and implementing breadth-first search algorithms. ([View Queue implementation](ds/Queue.go))

5. **Trees:** Trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes. They have a root node, branches, and leaves. Common types of trees include binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and B-trees. Trees are used in applications like hierarchical data representation and searching.

   - **Binary Tree**: A binary tree is a tree in which each node has at most two children, known as the left child and the right child. Binary trees are widely used and serve as the basis for many other tree-based structures.

   - **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary search tree is a binary tree with the additional property that for any given node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value. BSTs are used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of elements. ([View Binary Search Tree implementation](ds/BinarySearchTree.go))

   - **B-Tree**: A B-tree is a self-balancing tree structure designed for efficient disk storage and retrieval. It is commonly used in databases and file systems to maintain sorted data.

   - **B+ Tree**: A B+ tree is a variant of the B-tree that provides efficient range queries and is often used in databases to create index structures. Example: MongoDB

6. **Graphs:** Graphs are collections of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. They are used to represent complex relationships and are crucial for applications like network routing, social network analysis, and recommendation systems.

7. **Hash Tables:** Hash tables (or hash maps) use a hash function to map keys to values, allowing for efficient key-value pair lookups and insertions. They are used in data storage, caching, and database indexing.

8. **Heaps:** Heaps are specialized tree-based structures that maintain a particular ordering of elements. Min-heaps and max-heaps are commonly used for priority queue implementations and sorting algorithms.

9. **Trie:** A trie (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of strings or keys. It's often used in applications like autocomplete and spell checking.

10. **Bloom Filters:** Bloom filters are probabilistic data structures used to test whether an element is a member of a set. They are commonly used in caching, spell checking, and duplicate data detection.

11. **Skip Lists:** Skip lists are a data structure that combines elements of linked lists and trees. They provide efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations with probabilistic balancing.

12. **Self-Balancing Trees:** These are trees that automatically adjust their structure to maintain balance, such as AVL trees and Red-Black trees. They are used in applications where maintaining a balanced structure is critical for performance.

13. **Sparse Data Structures:** These structures are optimized for data with a significant number of empty or default values, such as sparse matrices and sparse arrays.

14. **Union-Find (Disjoint-Set) Data Structure:** Used for efficiently managing disjoint sets or partitions, often used in algorithms like Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm.

15. **Priority Queues:** Priority queues are abstract data types that provide efficient access to the highest-priority element. They are often implemented using heaps.

16. **Caches:** Cache data structures, like LRU (Least Recently Used) caches, are used to store frequently accessed data to improve access times.

These are just some of the many data structures available in computer science. The choice of data structure depends on the specific problem you are trying to solve and the performance characteristics required for your application. Proficiency in selecting and using the appropriate data structure is a crucial skill for software development and computer science.

## The Implementation

- The implementation uses Generics introduced in Go 1.18. Go being a statically typed language, this allows one to easily plugin additional types as desired.
- The core language has been used as much as possible without packages.
