# State Pattern

## Introduction

The State Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful when an object needs to change its behavior based on its internal state, and those changes are frequent and numerous.

The main idea behind the State pattern is to encapsulate the various states of an object into separate classes, and define interfaces for each state. These state classes handle the transitions between states and encapsulate the behavior associated with each state.

Here's how the State Design Pattern typically works:

1. **Context**: This is the object whose behavior changes based on its internal state. It maintains a reference to the current state object and delegates the state-specific behavior to that object.

2. **State**: This is an interface or abstract class that defines a common interface for all concrete state classes. It usually declares methods for performing actions associated with different states.

3. **Concrete States**: These are the concrete implementations of the State interface. Each concrete state class encapsulates the behavior associated with a particular state of the context object. These classes handle state transitions by updating the current state of the context object.

The State pattern promotes loose coupling between the context object and its states, making it easier to add new states and modify the behavior of existing ones without modifying the context class itself. It also makes the behavior of the context class more explicit and easier to understand by separating different behaviors into separate state classes.

> A formalized construct that manages state and transitions is called a **State Machine**. A **Finite State Machine** is a state machine that has a specific starting state, and a specific terminal state, after which the execution of the state machine is finished.

## Use Cases

The State pattern is useful in various scenarios where an object's behavior needs to change dynamically based on its internal state. Some practical use cases for the State pattern include:

1. **Workflow Management**: When modeling workflows with different states and transitions between them, such as order processing systems, document approval workflows, or ticketing systems.

2. **User Interface**: Managing the behavior of user interface elements that can have different states, such as buttons, checkboxes, or form fields.

3. **Game Development**: Implementing the behavior of game characters or entities that can have different states, such as idle, attacking, or moving.

4. **Networking**: Handling network connections that can be in various states, such as connected, disconnected, or waiting for response.

5. **Embedded Systems**: Controlling the behavior of devices or components that can operate in different modes or states, such as power-saving mode or active mode.

6. **Traffic Light Control**: Modeling the behavior of traffic lights with different states (e.g., red, yellow, green) and transitions between them.

**Popular libraries and frameworks that use the State pattern include**:

1. **Java Swing**: The Swing framework for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java uses the State pattern extensively, especially in components like buttons and menus.

2. **Redux (JavaScript)**: Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, commonly used with React. While not a strict implementation of the State pattern, Redux manages application state and transitions in a way that aligns with the principles of the State pattern.

3. **Django (Python)**: Django, a popular web framework for Python, provides a built-in state machine framework for managing the state of models, allowing developers to define states and transitions declaratively.

4. **.NET Framework**: The .NET framework provides support for implementing state machines using various approaches, including custom implementations following the State pattern.

5. **Spring State Machine (Java)**: Spring State Machine is a framework for creating finite state machines in Java applications, providing support for defining states, transitions, and actions associated with each state transition.

These libraries and frameworks leverage the State pattern to provide a flexible and maintainable way to manage stateful behavior in applications.

## Implementation in Go

Here's a simple example to illustrate the State pattern:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// State interface
type State interface {
	DoAction(c *Context)
}

// Concrete State A
type StateA struct{}

func (s *StateA) DoAction(c *Context) {
	fmt.Println("State A behavior")
	c.currentState = &StateB{} // State transition
}

// Concrete State B
type StateB struct{}

func (s *StateB) DoAction(c *Context) {
	fmt.Println("State B behavior")
	c.currentState = &StateA{} // State transition
}

// Context
type Context struct {
	currentState State
}

func (c *Context) SetState(state State) {
	c.currentState = state
}

func (c *Context) Request() {
	c.currentState.DoAction(c)
}

func main() {
	context := &Context{currentState: &StateA{}} // Initial state
	context.Request()                             // Output: State A behavior
	context.Request()                             // Output: State B behavior
	context.Request()                             // Output: State A behavior
}
```

In this example, the `Context` class changes its behavior based on its internal state (`StateA` or `StateB`). Each state class (`StateA` and `StateB`) encapsulates the behavior associated with that state, and the `Context` class delegates the behavior to the current state object.
In this Go implementation:

- We define the State interface with the `DoAction()` method.
- We implement two concrete states, `StateA` and `StateB`, each with its own `DoAction()` method.
- The `Context` struct maintains the current state and provides methods to set the state and to perform requests.
- In the `main()` function, we create a context with an initial state of StateA and call `Request()` method to demonstrate state transitions and behaviors.
