# Interface Segregation Principle

The Interface Segregation Principle states that you shouldn't put too much into one single interface and split it into multiple smaller interfaces based on functionality.

There's an acronym called YAGNI: You Aren't Going to Need It. It basically means, if you put too much into an interface you will force people into implementing things that they don't need, which will lead to problems.
