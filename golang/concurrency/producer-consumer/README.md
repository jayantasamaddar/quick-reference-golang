# Producer-Consumer problem

## The Classic Problem

## Case: Pizzeria

- **Producer**: A pizzeria which has some people who make pizzas and that will be the producer
- **Consumer**: One or more customers who will place orders at fairly regular intervals

The order goes to the pizzeria. Something might go wrong, somebody might quit, they might run out of an ingredient, whatever the case may be, but they'll try to make the pizza.

Our goal here is to ensure that we write a solution to the producer consumer problem.
