# The Sleeping Barber Problem

- A classic computer science problem introduced by Djikstra in 1965.
- A barber goes to a barbershop with a waiting room with a fixed number of seats.
- If no one is in the waiting room, the barber goes to sleep.
- When a client shows up, if there are no seats available, he or she leaves.
